Blockchain technology eliminates third-party intermediary and allows for veri.cation and transactions directly. The progress of blockchain technology can be classi.ed into four generations, i.e. Blockchain 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. Blockchain 1.0 was the .rst widely used cryptocurrency for payment systems of foreign exchange, small-value payments, one-to-one cash payment system, etc. Blockchain 2.0 deals with a smart contract, securities trading, smart property, payment clearing, banking instruments and many other areas of .nance. Blockchain 3.0 focuses on the regulation and governance of blockchain applications in the areas of government, health care, science and technology, culture and art (Swan, 
2015). Blockchain 4.0 is decentralizing and allowing the IT systems to do business integration, operating on cross blockchain business processes to support supply chain management, .nancial management systems, work.ow management and asset management (Alladi, 
2019; Srivastava, 
2018). 
Blockchain technology is reliable and decentralized network change the databases of the whole transaction records. The failure does not affect the whole network and ensures high reliability of applications which is made on the blockchain technology. Blockchain works on an extremely secured network of tamper-proofed nodes and highly ef.cient which runs through pre-set procedures (Casey 
et 
al., 
2018). In every generation, the bene.ts of blockchain technology are security, decentralization, transparency and immutability. Due to the unique capabilities of blockchain, it has been used in various sectors such as .nancial (Hyvärinen, 
2017), 
government 
(Alketbi, 
2018), 
education 
(Mahankali 
and 
Chaudhary, 
2020), health 
(Mettler, 
2016), 
tourism 
(Rashideh, 
2020), 
energy 
(Andoni, 
2019), 
public 
(Akaba, 
2020), banking (Rajnak 
and 
Puschmann, 
2020) 
and 
business 
(Morkunas 
et 
al.,2019). It is estimated that by 2025, 10% of the world’s GDP (US$100tn) will be controlled by the use of blockchain technologies (Tapscott 
and 
Tapscott, 
2017). Scholars around the globe are immensely exploring the area of blockchain and its underlying technology in different areas of businesses beyond governance and society. Blockchain technology has been de.ned on the basis of its features and uses in educational settings. For instance, one of the most cited studies de.ned the technology based on the platform created using blockchain technology called EduCTX. This platform constitutes a globally trusted, decentralized higher education credit transfer and grading system accepted worldwide for students and higher education institutions (HEIs), including other potential stakeholders, such as companies, institutions and organizations (Turkanovic 
et 
al.,2018). 
The blockchain technology structures have strong cybersecurity capabilities that have been used in various sectors. The application of blockchain technology in education is in its nascent stages. Further, blockchain in educational settings is a system used for issuing, validating, and sharing of certi.cates (Gräther 
et 
al., 
2018). A digitized, decentralized, open record of all cryptographic data exchanges, the technology in an educational environment, can make individuals to be the custodians of their of.cial education records where they can easily share their credentials with all interest parties (Han 
et 
al., 
2018). Though some educational institutions are using blockchain technology for the purpose of e-transcripts, digital degrees and certi.cation, but the progress is very slow that can be maximized to make a revolution in the education sector. The potential services for blockchain technology can be expanded to make a huge contribution to the education sector. This paper provides a systematic literature review on blockchain technology in education to offer a detailed understanding of the present scenario in terms of bene.ts, challenges, present Blockchain technology application and future areas where blockchain technology can be implemented in the education sector. Though some literature on the application of blockchain in education has been conducted in the past few years, but no systematic review has yet been done. Thus, this paper contributes to the literature on blockchain technology application in the present scenario, and future potential application in the other education .eld. The conclusions of the research offer policy-makers, higher education institutions, academicians, managers and researchers to use the potential bene.ts blockchain technology for the bene.t of the education sector. 
2. Objectives and methodology 
The purpose of this study is to systematically examine and present the current body of research literature that either quantitatively or qualitatively explored the use of blockchain technology in educational settings. The paper highlights the application of the technology in facilitating teaching, learning, and student activities management including administration activities at the school, college and universities with the help of a comprehensive review of the literature. The purpose is to explore the bene.t of using such technology. 
The following research questions guided this systematic literature review (SLR: 
RQ1. How blockchain technology has been de.ned in educational settings? 
RQ2. How were the technology examined (i.e. the methodology)? 
RQ3. What were the results of using this technology in an education system? 
The steps involved in conducting a systematic literature review as covered by previous studies (Frizzo-Barker 
et 
al.,2020; Tan 
et 
al.,2019; Parris 
and 
Peachey, 
2013; Okoli 
and 
Schabram, 
2010) have been followed. The authors have made an attempt to address this with the help of well formulated steps in the form of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagram and clearly mentioning the data search and inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study under consideration. The PRISMA diagram methodology has been followed below to depict the stages involved in the research study for the systematic review of literature. Figure 
1 
illustrates the research stages for systematic literature review. 
2.1 Stage 1: searching the academic database 
To meet the study objectives, published studies were identi.ed through searching for accessible SCOPUS database through the authors’university library system. All results were limited to English only with no restriction on the year of publication. The initial search was made using the keywords, i.e. “blockchain”“technology”in “education”. In total, we retrieved 204 documents containing the article, review paper, books, book chapters, editorials and conference papers. The number of documents containing the mentioned keywords was recorded. Figure 
2 
shows the count of document type retrieved from database. 

2.2 Stage 2: visualizing examination 
Next, we identi.ed the articles related and excluded the article not related to the topic. The inclusion criteria for the articles to be considered for further study was: 
the article to be in the English language; 
be a part of the article, the article in press and review paper (under document type) 
and not covered under conference review, conference paper, book chapter and 
editorial 
the article discusses blockchain technology in education as the main theme 
examines the use of blockchain technology under educational settings. 
Figure 1. 
Research stages for systematic literature review 


Figure 2. 
Count of document type retrieved from database 
Articles were excluded if the abstract, objectives and methodology, results and discussion sections of the respective study were not relevant to the present theme of the study. All articles were carefully screened based on the above-stipulated inclusion criteria. Finally, 36 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were selected from the peer-reviewed journals (n = 31) for the period 2017–2020. Under Section 3, Table 
3 
presents a list of those journals. 

2.3 Stage 3: analyzing the content 
In the .nal stage, we performed the content analysis of major articles by systematically reviewing the selected research articles and review papers by examining the objectives, methodology and .ndings of the paper. We also present the year-wise and geography wise publications along with article wise citations of publications to better understand the current state of literature. 
3. Literature review 
Blockchain technology as a part of the fourth industrial revolution is new to this world. The subject started gaining attention among researchers post-2016 after the introduction of cryptocurrency exchanges and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a mode of digital payment in some major economies of the world. The technology has been widely applied in all the major areas of research including education, the Internet of Things, banking, supply-chain, health care, defense, governance, etc. (Yaqoob 
et 
al.,2019; Hasselgren 
et 
al., 
2020). However, studies have also found that the application of blockchain is extremely immature and lacks public knowledge, making it hard to have a clear strategic vision of its true future potential. Presently, there are issues with scalability, the security of smart contracts and user adoption (Radanovic 
and 
Likic, 
2018). It is believed that blockchain technology may bring signi.cant changes in the connections between schools, colleges, universities and, thus, their relationship to society. 
To better demonstrate, some of the signi.cant contributions made by the existing studies are presented in Table 
1. 
The detailed surveys of the literature suggest the blockchain to be an evolving area of study which has tremendous application in education. The uses lie in student’s data and credentials management, administration activities, teaching and learning in schools and universities using online and brick and mortar systems. The technology has been put to use in all .elds of education including, engineering medicine, logistics, retail, marketing and .nance. 
Further, the year-wise and area-wise study on the topic around the globe has been presented. Figure 
3 
presents the break-up distribution of publications in the area. The graph suggests the area of blockchain technology in education is new and has started receiving attention starting 2017 from where it has been consistently growing and seems to grow in the times to come. 
Figure 
4 
depicts the year wise citation which is not impressive suggesting that being a new area of study the citations are limited. There lies tremendous scope to apply and carry research in the application of technology in the education system. 
Figure 
5 
presents country-wise publications in this emerging .eld of study. It can be observed that the researchers from the USA (seven) have the highest number of publications followed by India (5), Russia, Spain and China representing three publications each. Looking at less contribution, the application of blockchain technology in education becomes an area to study and explore in various parts of the world. 
Table 
2 
represents the studies on the topic with the maximum number of citations for the three years period starting 2017. 
From Table 
3, it can be observed that most of the published work is in the journals covering the topics of science and technology, medicine, marketing, law at school and higher education. This suggests that block technology and its application in education is a multidisciplinary area of research. Further, the number of publications is limited to a maximum of three publications per journal. This suggests the need to explore the area further for publication covering school education, online education and subjects of social sciences, business and management education. 
4. Results and discussion 
Based on the systematic review, it can be observed that most of the studies examined the blockchain technology in education were qualitative (Abdeldayem 
and 
Aldulaimi, 
2020; Jirgensons 
and 
Kapenieks, 
2018; Grewal 
et 
al., 
2018) and review based (Karale 
and 
Khanuja, 
2019; Hasselgren 
et 
al.,2020). There is a dearth of a quantitative study measuring the overall

Marketing educators need to incorporate technologies like AI and blockchain as a part of their curriculum as marketing strategies are based on these strategies nowadays Ethereum and Hyperledger fabric are mostly used blockchain technologies in health science 
The approach towards education is traditional and inappropriate and no country in GCC is among the top 10 leaders in crypto education 
With the help of blockchain, bogus creation of academic certi.cates can be avoided as the process of certi.cate veri.cation is easier 
It was found that the data stored can be accessed with its public, secure, and unique distributed ledger. Blockchain technology brings transparency to the details of students, faculty, and Institutions, facilitating the stakeholders and statutory bodies like UGC, AICTE and universities Besides helping, educators and learners in monitoring their learning outcomes blockchain technology can also be used for data management in an educational institution Blockchain technology is mostly used to issue and verify academic certi.cates. The technology can lower cost, enhance trust and transparency in sharing students’ data. The technology in the .eld is still unexploited

The measurable bene.ts expressed in monetary terms to all the stakeholders can be explored in the future. The following section discusses the results discusses, i.e. bene.ts, challenges, presents and potential applications of the blockchain technology in education sector. 
4.1 Bene.ts of blockchain technology in education 
Blockchain technology is an exciting area of emerging technology that has lot of potential to change the education sector. The bene.ts of blockchain technology in education are ranging from managing data to veri.cation of data without compromising authenticity. The blockchain data is available and veri.able 24/7 with full transparency. The blockchain technology is generally used for issuance and veri.cation of educational certi.cates like degrees, transcripts, students’ competencies, achievements and professional ability that can be veri.ed by employer worldwide (Alammary 
et 
al., 
2019). The blockchain technology streamlines the certi.cation process and the employer need to spend less time on the veri.cation of the academic results. It provides bene.ts to the education industry by providing a safe platform to share students’ data, enhancing trust, reducing cost and transparency. Blockchain technology keeps a complete record of course in data blocks in sequential order by timestamps. The old blocks and new data blocks cannot be deleted and the cryptographic algorithm prevents tampering of data and reduces frauds 
(Sun, 
2018). It builds virtual infrastructure for document storage, manages credentials and achievements

records of the students for the lifetime, thus bene.ting the universities by reducing administrative costs and bureaucracy procedures (Jirgensons 
and 
Kapenieks, 
2018). Blockchain technology is vital to solve scalability issues, privacy concerns, and reliability problems in several purviews (Malviya, 
2016). Alammary 
et 
al. 
(2019) 
highlighted several bene.ts of blockchain technology for education, i.e. high security, better control over data access, trust, low cost, identity veri.cation, ef.cient data management, interactivity and system interoperability, enhancing student’s assessments, students career decisions, accountability and transparency. Blockchain technology will end the paper-based system for education organizations permanently and securely. 

4.2 Barriers in adopting blockchain technology in education 
Blockchain technology offers many bene.ts to education, but it also faces various barriers in changing the traditional education system to adopt the blockchain technology system. Alammary 
et 
al. 
(2019) 
highlighted several barriers in adopting blockchain technology for education such as data unavailability, scalability, immaturity, cost, immutability, setting the boundaries, trust and weakening traditional school credentials. Educational Institution has massive student’s data and they need to keep track of every student. They continuously move from semester to semester and their records also keep on increasing. The student’s data is stored in the blockchain network which will increase its block size leads to an increase in the latency of the transaction. Blockchain network maintains records in every

block which makes repetitive and slow performer to retrieve records in terms of the number of transactions per second which leads to scalability problems (Vukolic 
2015). Adopting blockchain technology is a costly venture it includes infrastructure cost, the cost to manage big size data, time cost due to slow transactions and computing power cost (Saberi 
et 
al., 
2019). Every time adding new features would cost extra expenses. Due to frequent updates and adding new features can make data leakage that can become a security issue. Xu 
(2016) 
argued that even if it offers privacy and security, malicious attacks and data leakage can be a threatening barrier which makes education institution dif.cult to trust the blockchain technology. Several educational institutions are reluctant to share all data on a blockchain network and they cannot decide about the type data and services to be offered through the blockchain network (Sharples 
and 
Domingue, 
2016). Most of the institution already has a standard procedure for managing educational activities, blockchain technology requires extensive process alteration in the institutions set procedures. The blockchain system will integrate all students’ and educational data into blockchain ledgers. The immutability feature makes it challenging for educational institutions to implement new information storage

(Mitchell 
et

(Kosba 
et

4.3 Present blockchain technology application in the education sector 
Blockchain-based applications are still in their nascent stage though they are quickly gearing up steam in various .elds of education like certi.cates management (Xu 
et 
al.,2017), digital guardianship consent (Gilda 
and 
Mehrotra, 
2018), collaborative learning environment (Hori 
and 
Ohashi, 
2018), competencies and learning outcomes management (Duan 
et 
al., 
2017), learning system (Tolbatov 
et 
al., 
2018), competition management (Wu 
and 
Li, 
2018), copyrights management (Savelyev, 
2018), examination (Ito 
and 
O’Dair, 
2019), evaluating students’ professional ability (Zhao 
et 
al.,2019), lifelong learning (Mikroyannidis, 
2020), online education (Sun 
et 
al.,2018) and student capability evaluation system(Zhao 
et 
al., 
2019). Blockchain technology can solve many problems by exploring many possibilities for the education sector. In the education .eld, blockchain technology is mainly used for academic degree management to manage digital certi.cates of students’ academic credentials like marks sheet, transcripts, certi.cates and achievement records. These certi.cates have a high level of trust and privacy students can share it directly with anyone for veri.cation (Han 
et 
al., 
2018; Skiba, 
2017). 
Turkanovic 
et 
al. 
(2018) 
proposed the EduCTX platform for transferring credential records and fees among higher education institutions by eliminating the intermediary parties by using tokens to make a secured transfer process. Blockchain technology provides a learning system for a collaborative learning environment with high security level for teachers, students and authorities 
(Bdiwi, 
2018; Sharples 
and 
Domingue, 
2016). It also concentrates on competencies to improve the learning objectives and develop a wide spectrum of the education domain. Blockchain technology helps in evaluating student’s professional capability on qualitative and quantitative parameters which can be used by companies for providing employment opportunities (Williams, 
2019; Duan 
et 
al.,2017). Blockchain technology strengthens the examination and online quiz system, once the students’ answers 
are 
recorded 
then 
it 
cannot 
be 
altered 
by 
any 
party 
(Zhao 
et 
al.,2019). Bore 
(2017) 
presented the Information Hub system to accumulate, scrutinize and prepare data report for decision-making process in the education system. 

4.4 Prospective uses of blockchain technology in di.erent functions of an educational institution 
Blockchain technology is quite useful in securing information storage, sharing and networking. The distributed ledger technology can make many processes faster, easier, and safer. The technology can be used for better administration of admission process, assessing the record of participation in extracurricular activities, strengthening alumni network at schools and colleges, management of library and information services. It can also be useful in providing transportation facilities to students and staff. The technology can further bene.t teachers and researchers at school through the protection of intellectual property rights. 
4.4.1 Admissions. Most educational institutions as per their practice follow a model in which they control the record of students and their credentials. Consequently, there is a possibility where data can be altered, corrupted or deleted. Distributed ledger technology operating through a decentralized platform can share data in a secure manner to interested parties. This can also provide fraud resistance. This will encourage mobile learning styles among students who can easily ful.ll the admission formalities of different institutions around the globe. 
4.4.2 Library and information services. Library is one of the most important functions of any educational institute. Earlier books were issued to students either through manual record-keeping or with systems using bar code. Now, distributed ledger technology can be used to store and keep track of all necessary information including the movement of books and the number of students using a particular book. The different processes in the library can be well planned and managed using blockchain at schools, colleges or universities. 
4.4.3 Participation in extracurricular activities. Along with studies, a student participates in different extra-curricular activities at school, college or universities. The certi.cate of achievement demonstrating student’s participation and showing his or her contribution to an academic institute can be maintained and shared with interested parties as and when needed. The full proof system of peer to peer network consequently, shall improve the communication network among various stakeholders of an educational institution. 
4.4.4 Alumni partnership. Besides serving as a platform for transparent record-keeping, the system improves the relationship between teacher, staff, seniors and junior students by signi.cantly improving communication-related to lectures, subjects and events. All forms of students learning and necessary communication with the students can be developed with the help of a strong chain of blocks. This promotes strong long-term association between students and faculty. 
4.4.5 Transportation and hostel facilities. Usually, academic institutions provide transportation facilities to students and staff. To provide such facilities to students and staff with special needs, the ridesharing apps using blockchain technology can be used to organize carpools. This is much needed as a result of increased traf.c and congestion in urban areas. Such initiative by schools shall de.nitely provide a safe and comfortable ride to students and ease the burdens of parents. Further, the system can be used to allot hostel accommodation to students in need. 
4.4.6 
Intellectual property protection. Apart from teaching, research is an integral part of a lecturer or professor in a university. Under the traditional system, it is dif.cult to identify whether the similar academic study is ongoing? Additionally, research is sometimes not free from plagiarism. The use of blockchain helps address these problems. The decentralized peer to peer technology could allow educators to publish content openly while keeping track of reuse, without putting limitations on the source material. Further, a smart contract can track the citation details of authors and provide research incentives in the university system. 

5. 
Conclusion 


Blockchain technology provides a secure distributed ledger where it offers decentralize, secured, reliable and transparent systems. In the education sector, blockchain technology has been implemented in limited areas, but its potential is still untapped. Though a wide range of applications is emerging rapidly progress is very slow. The successful adoption of blockchain technology cannot be done without resolving the barriers. The paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the current development, bene.ts, challenges and present application of the technology in the educational environment. With reference to the current developments, there has been an increasing trend in the number of publications and citations in the .eld. Further, the highest number of publications is from the USA followed by India and Russia. The study further concludes that the application of blockchain in education management are still in their nascent stage though they are quickly gearing up steam in various .elds of education like certi.cates management, digital guardianship consent including the promotion of a collaborative learning environment. However, scalability, security and cost still remains the barrier and needs attention from the professionals in the .eld. 
6. Practical implication 
This research has identi.ed the bene.ts and barriers of blockchain technology in the education sectors. Identi.cation of bene.ts and barriers will help the education institution to build a clear strategic plan to take the advantage of blockchain technology to make their education institution safe, secure and sustainable for future. This research provides a groundwork for education institutions, the policymakers and researchers to explore other areas where blockchain technology can be implemented. Though this research has also suggested some prospective uses of blockchain technology in different functions of an education system, but more application can be brought into the education system to exploit the potential of blockchain technology. 
7. Limitation and future scope of research 
Systematic review as a methodology have certain limitations as a result of publication bias, document search and sample selection bias. Publication bias occurs when more positive .ndings than negative ones are published in academic journals. In addition, sample selection bias and document search bias may occur while making selection criteria for executing the query to select and include the topic for study (Frizzo-Barker 
et 
al., 
2020; Kitchenham, 
2004). This research provides footprints for education sectors to understand the bene.ts of blockchain technology in the present scenarios and has also recommended some potential uses of blockchain technology. Future integrated research need to be done by collaborating Information technology (IT) sector for designing the IT architecture and framework for exploring more potential use of blockchain technology in education.
