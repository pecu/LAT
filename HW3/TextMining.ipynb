       "\"The paper is a systematic literature review of blockchain technology in education, which includes a bibliometric analysis to gather data on its definitions, methodology, results, and potential uses. The study identifies the benefits, barriers, and applications of the technology in the education sector, as well as potential future areas for its implementation. This is among the first reviews to cover all aspects of blockchain technology in education, making it a valuable resource for educators and researchers.Blockchain technology is a decentralized system that eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries in transactions. It has evolved through four generations, offering features such as smart contracts, securities trading, and governance. It has been applied in various sectors, including finance, government, education, healthcare, energy, public, banking, and business. Blockchain's potential in education is exemplified by platforms like EduCTX, providing a globally trusted credit transfer and grading system. Its strong cybersecurity capabilities make it useful in various fields. It is estimated that by 2025, blockchain technologies will control 10% of the world's GDP.The paper discusses the usage of blockchain technology in the education sector by exploring its potential benefits, challenges, and services that can revolutionize the sector. The study reviews the current research literature and presents the application of blockchain technology in facilitating teaching, learning, and student activities management. It follows the PRISMA methodology and contributes to the literature by providing policymakers, academicians, and researchers with potential benefits and future applications of blockchain technology in the education sector.This document outlines the process for conducting a systematic literature review on the topic of blockchain technology in education. The process includes searching for relevant articles using specific keywords, analyzing and evaluating the retrieved articles based on certain inclusion criteria, and performing content analysis to identify the major relevant articles. The aim of the literature review is to provide an overview of the current state of research on the topic of blockchain technology in education.The literature review shows that blockchain technology has potential applications in education, but there are obstacles to overcome, including scalability, smart contract security, and user adoption. Nevertheless, the technology can have various uses in education, like data management, administration, and teaching. Although research on the topic is still limited, there have been qualitative studies in areas like science and technology, medicine, marketing, and law. More research is needed in multidisciplinary areas like social sciences, business, and management education.\""

       "'This article presents a systematic review of research on how blockchain technology is being used in higher education to improve efficiency, effectiveness, privacy control, technological improvement and security of data management mechanisms. The study suggests that blockchain is being used to develop new interventions to improve the ways knowledge data and student records are shared, delivered, and secured. The review integrates 37 articles providing up-to-date knowledge on current implications of blockchain in higher education. The article also suggests some challenges and further research directions.The study looks at how blockchain can contribute to higher education by improving IT infrastructure and computing solutions to promote, maintain, or restore the educational system, and ensuring privacy and security of academic diplomas and degrees. Previous systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have focused on underscoring areas of blockchain application, but a more focused discussion is needed on the areas of improvement from its adoption. The study addresses this by carrying out a Systematic Bibliometric Literature Review (LRSB) and categorizes prior studies based on their application areas. The study aims to unveil existing knowledge gaps and future directions for research.The article discusses how blockchain technology can be beneficial for the higher education sector, by providing more secure and decentralized storage and sharing of data such as diplomas and certificates. The article also explores the potential challenges and limitations in adopting this technology, as well as the different applications of blockchain in various sectors. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for further research and development in this area.The article discusses the potential of blockchain technology in higher education and the challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges include a lack of trust from employers due to inaccuracies in student resumes, a lack of understanding of blockchain technology, and the shortcomings of traditional education methods in preparing students for the workforce. The authors carried out a literature review using a LRSB approach, resulting in the selection of 37 publications on the topic. The article concludes by highlighting the need for further research and development to overcome the current challenges and maximize the benefits of blockchain in higher education.The article reports on the publications in the field of Higher Education until 2020, and highlights a sharp interest in research on the blockchain system. The analysis of Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) reveals that Interactive Learning Environments is the top journal with an SJR of 1.230 and a Q1 ranking, followed by IEEE Access with an SJR of 0.780 and a Q1 ranking. Overall, journals from the best quartile Q1 represent 16% of the 31 journal titles.'"
